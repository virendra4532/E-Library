            <p>The Joy of Cooking became a bestseller originally due to its readability for the middle classes and Rombauer's unique style.</p> 
            <p>Her recipes were designed specifically for middle-class people doing most of their own cooking for their family.</p>
            <p> She specifically tested and practiced the recipes to ensure they could be produced easily in a relatively brief period of time without much complication. </p>
            <p>Once she combined her witty comments on the cooking and serving with the action method, her cookbook became readily readable by the average cook in America. </p>
            <p>Moreover, Rombauer paired the conversational style of the recipes with casual discussions of etiquette and hosting. </p>
            <p>Her methods were distinct from the other cookbooks of the time, which featured many complex recipes, while her style was simple and conversational.</p>
